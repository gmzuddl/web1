    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most
      often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces
      written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML
      document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering
      in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a
      cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging
      webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for
      many mobile applications.
