    Cascading Style Sheets (<a href="www.naver.com">CSS</a>) is a style sheet
    language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web
    pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be
    applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is
    applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and
    JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create
    visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user
    interfaces for many mobile applications.
